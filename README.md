# GPT-powered Text Summarizer

## Overview
This project features an AI-powered text summarizer designed to efficiently condense large documents into concise summaries. Utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques, it focuses on extracting key information while maintaining the core essence of the original text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- An [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API key
- Required Python packages: 
  - `nltk`
  - `openai`
  - `pathlib`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `requests`
  - `tqdm`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Set your OpenAI API key in an environment variable or modify `main.py` to include your API key.

## Usage
1. Place the text you want to summarize in `input.txt`.
2. Run the script: `python main.py`.
3. Find the summarized text in `output.txt`.
4. Check `gpt_logs` and `summarizer.log` for detailed logs and API responses.

## Customization
- Modify `CHUNK_SIZE` in `main.py` to adjust the size of text chunks for summarization.
- Change prompts in `main.py` to alter the summarization style as per your requirements.
